Playwright automation poc


First, you need to install Node (I'm using node 20*)

```bash
Go to https://nodejs.org. and download it
```

Now, we need to install playwright

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

After that, we can run our tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

We can see our report with that command

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
